The wind lasts for the spellï¿½s duration.* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.* It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.";
