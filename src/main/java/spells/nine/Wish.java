                "alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.The basic use of this spell is to " +
                "duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that " +
                "spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.* You create one object of up to " +
                "25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any " +
                "dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.* You allow up to twenty " +
                "creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in " +
                "the _greater restoration_ spell.* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a " +
                "damage type you choose.* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or " +
                "other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions " +
                "immune to a lich's life drain attack.* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any " +
                "roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accomodate " +
                "the new result. For example, a _wish_ spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's " +
                "critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or " +
                "disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.You might be able to" +
                " achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as" +
                " possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the " +
                "wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect" +
                " you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a " +
                "result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you " +
                "forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the " +
                "game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the" +
                " presence of the item's current owner.The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other " +
                "than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell " +
                "until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage " +
                "can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, you Strength drops to 3 if it isn't 3 or " +
                "lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more " +
                "than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 " +
                "percent chance that you are unable to cast _wish_ ever again if you suffer this stress.";
